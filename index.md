JuMP is a modeling language and supporting packages for mathematical
optimization in [Julia](https://julialang.org).

## 4th annual JuMP-dev

We are pleased to announce that the 4th annual JuMP-dev workshop will be held
June 15-17 2020 in [Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium](https://goo.gl/maps/fyxqevrKn76nvhwq9),
in conjunction with UCLouvain.

Further details, including a call for speakers, will be announced shortly.

For information on the previous JuMP-dev workshops, see:
[2019](meetings/santiago2019/), [2018](meetings/bordeaux2018/), [2017](meetings/mit2017/).

## Getting started

To get started, read the [Installation Guide](https://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/)
in the JuMP documentation.

Once you've installed JuMP, a good next step is the [Quickstart Guide](https://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/stable/quickstart/).

There are also a number of tutorials available at [JuMPTutorials.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMPTutorials.jl).

If you need help, search the [Forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt)
for similar questions, or open a new one.

For more information, see the book, [Julia Programming for Operations Research](http://www.chkwon.net/julia/),
which covers a variety of topics on optimization, with an emphasis on solving
practical problems using JuMP and Julia.
