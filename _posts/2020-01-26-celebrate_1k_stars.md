JuMP just received its 1000th star on GitHub! We will use this milestone to recap JuMP's growth and other important milestones since its beginnings as an experimental project in 2012.

While tracking the success of an open-source project is known to be a hard problem, we have a few metrics available to us.
The number of citations of the two main JuMP papers are 253+428 (with some possible double counting).
Currently 71 developers have added some contribution in some of the 3747 commits of the JuMP repository made available in 67 releases. And this is only data from the main JuMP repo. The ecosystem has many other repos ranging from [MathOptInteface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl) (the abstraction on which JuMP is built) to solver wrappers.

The number of stars of a GitHub project is yet another indicator, because it means people are adding the project to their list of favorites. However, people that starred JuMP are not necessarily users and many users don't star JuMP (if that applies to you, consider giving us a star!), therefore its not a precise metric.

Milestones like reaching 1000 stars are proud moments for the developers and help motivate more work and new developments.

We thank our users and contributors for all the stars! Keep staring, opening (and solving) issues and posting questions on discourse. This is the best way to keep our community growing and making JuMP closer and closer to 1.0!
